                <div id="para1" class="servicePara">
                    <p>I volunteered at the library from 2014 to 2019,
                        where I was heavily involved with putting books back, as well
                        as cleaning around the shelves of the library. It may not seem like it, but
                        volunteering here has made me into the person I am today. I would spend countless hours being
                        lost within books. Doing this service, also helped me navigate around a library really well, as
                        I was
                        originally extremely clueless before. Volunteering at the library taught me many qualities, and
                        has also helped me
                        become more selfless, and much more extroverted due to the fact that I had to help many people
                        find books. Click <a target="_blank" class="external"

                <div id="para2" class="servicePara">
                    <p>I am currently working as a peer teacher for ENGR 102, where I am
                        happy to teach students about Python, as well as encourage them to
                        continue programming during their time here at Texas A&M. A great deal
                        of the students have not worked with programming before, so I would like
                        to help these students. Essentially, my job is to guide students with labwork, homework, and
                        any other concepts of Python. This acts as a great introduction to engineering, because
                        there are many fields within A&M engineering that utilizes Python.</p>

                    <p>I enjoy doing this work because allows me to give students the mentorship, that I felt
                        that I did not have from my TA's. I want all the incoming students to succeed while also
                        recognizing what they enjoy, as well as what major within engineering they should decide upon.
