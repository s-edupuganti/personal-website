            <!-- <p>Howdy! I'm a Junior Honors Computer Science student with a minor in Cybersecurity.
                I'm coming from Pennsylvania, however I was born in Austin, and grew up there. Coming back to
                Texas was a choice that I am glad I made. I was able to meet a lot of new people, as well as new friends
                here.
                Admitting to Texas A&M University was one of the best decisions I have ever made. I am also involved
                with
                Cybersecurity Club and Engineering Mentorship Council. Currently, I am also a peer teacher for ENGR 102,
                in
                which I am able to help students with their Python assignments.
            </p>

            <p> Some of the current courses that I am taking include: <span style="font-weight: bold">Analysis of
                    Algorithms</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">intro
                    to Computer Systems</span>, and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Law Policy in Cybersecurity</span>.
                Unfortunately, as much as I wish to express
                my excitement to take these classes, I am afraid that this is not possible. However, <span
                    style="font-weight: bold;">Programming Studio</span> has
                been a delight so far. Currently, I am looking into an internship for Summer 2022, or more specifically into Software
                Engineering or Cybersecurity roles. These are my main focus areas, as they are the ones that I am most interested in.
            </p>

            <p>Typically in my free time I enjoy playing video games, watching anime, and hanging out with my friends.
                Notice how I didn't say
                programming? Some of the video games that I play include Fortnite, Genshin Impact, Among Us, and Super
                Smash Bros. Eating food is also a big hobby of mine. I love tasting new food, and experiencing different cultures.
                My favorite restaurant in College Station is McDonalds. On a real note, I really enjoy eating at KluayI also love
                music and I am always looking to listen to new music. Currently, my favorite artists include Lil Uzi Vert, Playboi Carti,
                and Denzel Curry.
            </p> -->

            <p>Howdy! My name is Sidharth Edupuganti, and I am currently a Juniors Honors Computer Science major with a
                Cybersecurity minor. I am also currently doing a concentration area in Business, where if time permits,
                I will complete the Business minor with my remaining semesters. Beyond being in the College of
                Engineering, I am involved with <a class = "external" target="_blank" href="https://cybr.club/index.html">Cybersecurity Club</a> as well as <a
                    target="_blank" class = "external" href="https://stuactonline.tamu.edu/app/organization/profile/public/id/1900">Engineering Mentorship Council</a>. Within
                Cybersecurity Club, I have been involved with various CTF (Capture-The-Flag) competitions, as well as
                other projects. Engineering Mentorship Council allows me to talk to various freshman within the College
                of Engineering, and be able to guide them in their path to become a successful engineer. It also allows
                these mentees to ask any questions, and I do my best help them. I am also a Peer Teacher for ENGR 102 at
                <a target="_blank" class = "external" href="https://www.tamu.edu/">Texas A&M University</a>,
                where I assist and grade students coding assignments pertaining to Python. Akin to the Engineering
                Mentorship Council, this gives me another way to help guide freshmen and give them options, that I felt
                that I did not have during my freshman year.</p>
            <p>While being involved with these organizations, I am also taking vital courses to help further my own
                degree such as Analysis of Algorithms, Introduction to Computer Systems, Law & Policy in Cybersecurity,
                as well as the very own Programming Studio. I am currently looking for an internship for this Summer
                2022, where I am looking for roles relating to Software Engineering and Cybersecurity. Within software
                engineering, the roles that would best suit me are full stack development, where I am able to work on
                both parts of a website: the front end and the back end.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, watching anime, and coding! Despite being for a class, the
                current website you are looking at was extremely fun albeit extensive to construct, and I hope to
                develop more projects such as this in the near future. If you would like to know more about me, feel
                free to shoot me an email or connect with me on <a target="_blank" class = "external" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sedupuganti/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
